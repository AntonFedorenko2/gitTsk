We were tight, but it falls apart as silver turns to blue
Waxing with a candlelight, and burning just for you
Allocate your sentiment, and stick it in a box
I've never been an extrovert, but I'm still breathing
Someone tried to do me ache
Someone tried to do me ache
Someone tried to do me ache (it's what I'm afraid of)
Someone tried to do me ache (it's what I'm afraid of)
With hindsight, I was more than blind, lost without a clue
Thought I was getting carat gold, and what I got was you
Stuck inside the circumstances, lonely at the top
I've always been an introvert
Happily bleeding
